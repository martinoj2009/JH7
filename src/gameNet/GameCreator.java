 The normal class that gets the show on the road looks like the following:

 public class MyMain extends GameCreator{

  }
  


  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException

<h3>Things to note:</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>GameCreator</b> is an abstract method and extending this class requires us to have the method <b>createGame</b></li>
<li>GameCreator contains the <b/>enterGame</b> which is responsible for asking the questions:
<pre>
Enter your name:
Server side of game?(y/n)
etc. 
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

	 * 
	 @param yourUserInterface - You need to pass in an instance of your user interface.  This class 
	 * must implement the GameNet_UserInterface interface.  
	 * 
	 * <h3>Here is the sequence that happens in enterGame to start up the whole game:</h3>
	 * <ol>
	<li>Your MyMain constructs an instance of your user interface code and passes it into the enterGame Method.</li>
	<li>The enterGame method then asks the questions you have all seen that are listed above.</li>
	<li>After the questions have been asked the GameCreator knows enough to put the pieces together as follows:</li>
	<li>A GameControl class is constructed in one of 2 flavors.  If we are on the Server, 
	then the GameControl class will create a Server task and do all of the associated Server jobs. </li>
	<li>If our GameControl contains the Server task, then it will also call the  method createGame  to 
	obtain  an instance of your game.  </li> 
	<li>If we are not a Server, then the GameControl merely records the IP address and the port number so that
	we connect to the real Server as a client using sockets.</li>
	<li>At this point the enterGame constructs the <b>GamePlayer</b> class that is the glue(threads, sockets, etc.)  
	that connects your user interface to it's mygame.</li>
	<li>The GamePlayer will maintain the Player's name, his GameControl object and the user interface 
	object passed into the enterGame method.</li>
	<li>The last thing done by enterGame is to call the <b>startUserInterface</b> method in 
	your user interface to pass in a reference to your GamePlayer object and to let you know
	that everything is now connected. </li>
	
	
	</ol>
